# 8 Week SQL Challenge 🚀  
### Solutions and Walkthroughs for the [#8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) by [Danny Ma](https://www.datawithdanny.com/)

This repository includes my complete SQL solutions for each of the case studies in Danny Ma's [#8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/).  

I took this challenge and found it to be one of the most effective and comprehensive SQL practice resources available online. The questions go beyond simple syntax and really test your logical thinking and ability to work with real-world datasets. At times, I referred to others’ work to better understand advanced techniques or find more optimized ways to reach the solution.

I’ve added comments where necessary to make the queries easier to follow for others who may be learning as well.

### Special Acknowledgments  
I’d like to highlight some repositories and resources that were incredibly valuable in my learning process. If you’re thinking about enrolling in [Serious SQL](https://www.datawithdanny.com/), I highly recommend it — it's one of the most practical SQL courses available.

All queries were written and tested using PostgreSQL inside a Docker container for consistency.
